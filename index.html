       You can use the 
  line height property to help create space between lines; Use the line-Height: with 1.5 em to create 
  more space between lines and help text be more readable like the one you are reading right now. There are btw 
  four diffrent boxes in the CSS Box Model. First is the actual content where we put in images, texts, videos, 
  audio etc. Every single element has these 4 boxes around it. THe padding, border, and margin are all invisible 
  unless we specify its properties. To see boxes put in background color, Add padding to create more space for boxes 
  to make the boxes bigger. You can add border to the boxes as well and there are three properties for border which are border-color, border-width, and border-style: solid; etc.
