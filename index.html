This time, ArenaNet decided to finally give us a glimpse on the final two races, Sylvari and Asura. While it’s sometimes tricky to figure out how tough things are, everything here drops QL 10 gear, which is the highest QL I’m aware of. The controls do everything you would expect, even allowing you to touch the characters and enemies you want to perform an action without forcing you to utilize old school menus.</p></div><div class="middle"></div><div class="right"><h2>Placeholder</h2><p>Orcs, trolls, undead, cattle, space squid goats with gazelle legs - are you kidding me? One realm and one economy would make me curl up into the fetal position on my floor, muttering about competition for my flowers. A Hurricane battlecruiser and Buzzard are on d-scan in C2a, along with a tower, but I see no wrecks and no anomalies. I’ve thus been scouring the various GW2 fansites for the last week, trying to match up armour types, professions, and races. The hunter-type that has great knowledge of nature and wildlife around her. I hope I can fight with animals on my side.</p></div>
