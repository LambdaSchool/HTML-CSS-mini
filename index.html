            You will be turning the provided wireframe into a page. For your first implementation, 
            use only box model rules. Half way through the allotted time, refactor what you have to 
            use flexbox. Make your second solution on a second branch.
            You're provided with an index.html file and a styles.css file to begin with, but you're 
            welcome to restructure as you see fit. The mockups are also in the mockup folder for your 
            reference. The full width version is the first you'll be implementing. The mid and small 
            are for extra credit.
